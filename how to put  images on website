In order to put images on our website,we need to use <img> element.
!note:
  <img>is a empty element,which means that it has no text content or closingtag.
1.Attribe:src(title:source)
  When we want to embed an image to a website,we can use the src attribte that the browser where the image is.The src attribute can
use absolur and relative url.
  -if the image and your websites html are under the same directory,the vaule of src attribute ,you can embed your image like this.
  <img src="dinosaur.jpg">
  -if the image was in a images subdirectory which is in the same directory of html,you can embed your image like this:
  <img src="images/dinosaur.jpg>
  -if the image was in a images subdirectory and the html was in a websites subdirectory,while the image  and the website are in
  the same directory,you can embed image like this:
  <img src="../images/dinosaur.jpg">
2.Attribute alt(title: altnative)
  -what the attribte is: textual description of the image
  -why to use the attribute: used in situations where images can't be seen/displayed.
3.Width and height attribute
function: we can use this two attribute to specify the width and height of the image and what is important is that if the website 
have not load the image yet,it will leave a space for the image to appear in.
!Note: We don't use the attributes to resize the image.If you really want to resize your image ,you should uss css.
4.Title attribute
Function: when user put their printer on the image,it'll show further imformations about the image.
What is more.If we want to add a caption to the image,we can use <figure> and <figcaption> elements.Just like this:
<figure>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/multimedia-and-embedding/images-in-html/dinosaur_small.jpg"
       alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
            it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
       width="400"
       height="341">
  <figcaption>A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum.</figcaption>
</figure>
